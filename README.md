## How to play

- You can play directly [within your browser](https://app.cu.bzh/?worldID=13693497-03fd-4492-9b36-9776bb11d958) (Chrome, Firefox). You can also [install Cubzh](https://cu.bzh/get) (Windows, macOS, iOS, Android), but direct link won’t work in that case, you’ll need to search “LD52” or “Eat your fruits” (game by aduermael).
- It’s a multiplayer game, so while you can visit the map on your own, use the [same link](https://app.cu.bzh/?worldID=13693497-03fd-4492-9b36-9776bb11d958) to invite friends.
